# MF Screener AI

A vibecoding project to analyze mutual funds using AI-generated strategies. This project uses multiple AI models (Claude, Gemini, Codex) to create quantitative scoring algorithms for mutual funds.

## Workflow

1.  **Data Fetching**: The `MfDataProvider` fetches mutual fund metadata and historical NAV data from TickerTape.
2.  **Algorithm Scoring**: Different AI models (Claude, Gemini, Codex) have generated Python scripts to analyze the data and score funds based on various metrics like CAGR, Sharpe Ratio, Alpha, Momentum, etc.
3.  **Compilation**: The scores from all models are compiled and normalized to create a final composite ranking.
4.  **Publishing**: The results are published to a Google Sheet for easy viewing and filtering.

## Disclaimers

*   **Not Financial Advice**: The strategies and scores generated in this project are for educational and experimental purposes only. They are AI-generated and should not be considered as financial advice.
*   **AI-Generated**: The logic and code for the scoring algorithms were primarily generated by AI models. While they use standard financial metrics, they may have biases or errors.
*   **Data Accuracy**: Data is fetched from third-party sources and its accuracy is not guaranteed.

## For Developers: Create Your Own Algorithm

This project is designed to be **forked and customized**. The core workflow is simple:

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Modify** `tasks/2_algorithm.md` to specify your target sector and AI model
3. **Use Cursor** (or your preferred AI coding assistant) to generate a new scoring algorithm
4. **Run** the generated script to score funds in your chosen sector
5. **Compare** your results with existing models

The beauty of this approach is that each AI model brings a different perspective. Claude focuses on adaptive conviction, Gemini emphasizes multi-factor regression, and Codex uses walk-forward validation. **What strategy will your model create?**

See [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP.md) for detailed instructions on running Task 2 Algorithm.
