# MF Screener AI

A vibecoding project to analyze mutual funds using AI-generated strategies. This project uses multiple AI models (Claude, Gemini, Codex) to create quantitative scoring algorithms for mutual funds.

## Workflow

1.  **Data Fetching**: The `MfDataProvider` fetches mutual fund metadata and historical NAV data from TickerTape.
2.  **Algorithm Scoring**: Different AI models (Claude, Gemini, Codex) have generated Python scripts to analyze the data and score funds based on various metrics like CAGR, Sharpe Ratio, Alpha, Momentum, etc.
3.  **Compilation**: The scores from all models are compiled and normalized to create a final composite ranking.
4.  **Publishing**: The results are published to a Google Sheet for easy viewing and filtering.

## Disclaimers

*   **Not Financial Advice**: The strategies and scores generated in this project are for educational and experimental purposes only. They are AI-generated and should not be considered as financial advice.
*   **AI-Generated**: The logic and code for the scoring algorithms were primarily generated by AI models. While they use standard financial metrics, they may have biases or errors.
*   **Data Accuracy**: Data is fetched from third-party sources and its accuracy is not guaranteed.
